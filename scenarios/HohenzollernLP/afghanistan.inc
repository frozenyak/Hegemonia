	# Even though it was actually a brigade, I made Farah cavalry to have 
	# max_strength of 100.
	# This is because Afghani army had several smaller but still independent 
	# cavalry units.
	# I also put max_strength 80 for smaller infantry divisions to differ them 
	# from mixed infantry divisions.
	# Mixed infantry divisions had also cavalry attachments, and thus their 
	# strength was higher than strength of regular infantry divisions.
