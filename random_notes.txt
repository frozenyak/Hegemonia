as the roman commies, i decide to try to annex Egypt. Germany therefore declares war on me. Fine, i understand their reasons. But wouldn't it be cool if they send me an ultimatum instead ? "Stop your senseless warmongering in the land of Pharaoh now, else German troops shall parade in the Colosseum soon !

I needed to use that ability because after I gave Indian back to Byzantium, Lithuania and I (Germany) still held most/all of the Middle east, and I couldn't figure out a way to give it back to India, thereby creating a land-bridge. 
It'd be helpful to have for them, 'cause I'm pretty sure that's also what happened in the AAR.
